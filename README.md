# 📊 Ad Performance Analysis (Python EDA + Power BI Dashboard)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes **digital advertising performance** across platforms (Facebook & Instagram) using **Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Power BI for interactive dashboards**.

The goal is to understand **campaign effectiveness, audience engagement, and conversion behavior** and present insights that support **data-driven marketing decisions**.

The dashboard is divided into **three main sections**:

---

## 1️⃣ Campaign Overview
- Total impressions, clicks, engagement, and purchases
- Click Through Rate (CTR), Engagement Rate, Conversion Rate
- Total budget and average budget spent
- Platform-wise comparison (Facebook vs Instagram)

---

## 2️⃣ Audience & Engagement Analysis
- Engagement and comments by gender
- Engagement by age group
- Country-wise engagement distribution
- Weekly engagement and comments trends
- Engagement by event hours

---

## 3️⃣ Ad Performance Analysis
- Performance comparison by ad type (Image, Video, Carousel, Stories)
- Engagement and comments trends over time
- Purchase and conversion behavior analysis
- Identification of high-performing ad formats

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - pandas, numpy  
  - matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation & visualization  
- **DAX** – KPI calculations and dynamic measures  
- **Excel / CSV** – Data cleaning and preprocessing

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
EDA was performed in **Jupyter Notebook** to understand data patterns before building the dashboard.

### EDA Activities:
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values
- Data type corrections
- Summary statistics
- Platform-wise performance comparison
- Distribution analysis (age, engagement, comments)
- Correlation analysis between clicks, engagement, and purchases
- Outlier detection

### Key EDA Insights:
- Instagram has higher engagement compared to Facebook
- Video ads consistently generate more interactions
- Engagement peaks during evening hours
- Certain age groups drive higher conversions
- Strong correlation between clicks and purchases

## 📊 Important Charts Used
- **KPI Cards** – Impressions, Clicks, Engagement, Purchases, Budget, Rates
- **Donut Chart** – Gender-wise engagement distribution
- **Bar Chart** – Engagement by age group and ad type
- **Line Chart** – Weekly engagement and comments trend
- **Stacked Column Chart** – Ad type performance over time
- **Map Visual** – Country-wise engagement and comments
- **Calendar Heatmap** – Monthly engagement activity
